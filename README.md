Timesheet helper 
User makes a selection, which includes clock-in, start break, end break, and clock-out
creates a timestamp for each selecton 

To- do:
I would like to make timestamp 'responsive' to individual user's actual timezone
I would like for timestamp to count down from start break to end break
